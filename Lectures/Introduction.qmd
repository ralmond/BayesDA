## Class Project

Part 1 (Due by Spring Break).

Pick a data set and do a "classical" analysis.

Part 2 (Due by End of Semester)

Fit a Bayesian model to those data.

Email: <ralmond@fsu.edu>

* Speed Up

* Slow Down

* I have a question


People on Zoom, feel free to unmute and ask questions.

Post on Discussion Forum

Come to coffee hours & online reviews.

Let me know if you have problems reading material

-   Problems distinguishing black and red
-   Let me know if you need better closed captions on videos

## What to do if you are lost

Confusion is a part of learning

-   But it should be temporary

*Post questions in class forums!*

*Come to Tea and Coffee Hours*

*Make an appointment*

Be specific about what is confusing you


# An Introduction to Bayesian Thinking

## Quiz 1

A person takes an aptitude test that has an SEM of 5, and gets a score of 80.  The test scores are approximately normally distributed in the population of interest. 

Confidence Interval:  
$$ 80 \pm 2\cdot 5 = (70, 90)$$

Use the classical Neyman-Pearson definition of a confidence interval, which is larger?

A) The probability that the person't true aptitute is between 70 and 90
B) 95 \%
C) A and B are about the same.
D) Can't tell from the information provided.

## Parameters

* In the Neyman-Pearson framework, parameters are fixed but unknown.

* All of the probability comes from the construction of the interval.

* The classical confidence interval provides a mathematically precise answer to the wrong question.
